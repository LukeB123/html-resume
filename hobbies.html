<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>
    During the lockdown, I took the opportunity to develop my programming skills by recreating the popular board game Scotland 
    Yard using Unity engine, and C# and storing my code on GitHub. I also took online courses in Python and Java to expand my
    knowledge in programming. I have a strong desire for personal development and learning new skills, I taught myself piano and I
    am now looking to take recognised piano grade exams. I have always been a team player and I have demonstrated my skills in
    teamwork and leadership as a member of the American Football team throughout my time at university. My passion for board
    games led me to establish a board game community within my workplace, connecting colleagues with shared interests across
    various departments within the business. I am dedicated to maintaining my fitness and regularly engage in weightlifting. I built a
    home gym and ran fitness sessions over Zoom for friends whilst in lockdown. I also showcased my creativity and artistic talent
    through T-Shirt designing and printing, which I wear myself or sell to friends.
