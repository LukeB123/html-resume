    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>
        A Master's graduate in Mathematics, seeking opportunities to leverage my strong mathematical background and software
        development experience in the tech and data industry. I have a track record of achieving high academic grades, particularly in
        challenging modules such as Linear Algebra, Group Theory, and Quantum Mechanics. I am a self-motivated, self-starter with a
        determined work ethic, and I can deliver results whether working independently or as part of a team. My ability to think holistically
        and visually, enables me to approach complex problem-solving with creative solutions. In addition, I possess strong interpersonal
        skills and I can inspire and coach others effectively. I also have entrepreneurial and volunteering experience which support my
        professional development.
